Clearing the canvas before each frame

The ball is leacing a trail because we're painting an ew circle on every frame without removing the previous one. Dont worry because there's a method to clear canvas content: clearRect().

This methods= takes four parameters: the x and y coordinates of the top left corner of a rectangle, and the x and y coordinated of the bottom right corner of a rectangle.

The whole area covered by this rectangle will be cleared of any content previously painted there.

add the following highlighted enw line to the draw() function:

function draw() {
ctx.clearRect (0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(x, y, 10, 0, Math.PI \* 2);
ctx.fillStyle = "#0095DD"
ctx.fill();
ctx.closePath();
x += dx;
y += dy;
}

Cleaning up out code 
we will be adding more and more commands to the draw() function in the next few articles, so it's good to keep it as simple and clean as possible. Let's start by moving the ball drawing code to a separate function. 

Replace the existing draw() function with the following two functions:

We've drawn our ball and gotten it moving, but it keep disappearing off the edge of the canvas. In the third chapter we'll explore how to make it bounce off the walls. 

Bounce off the walls

it is nice  to see our ball moving, but it quickly disappears from the screen, limiting the fun we can have with it.
